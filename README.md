{Shan, Shui}\* is inspired by [traditional Chinese landscape scrolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shan_shui) (such as [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwelling_in_the_Fuchun_Mountains) and [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Ximeng)) and uses noises and mathematical functions to model the mountains and trees from scratch. It is written entirely in javascript and outputs Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format.
